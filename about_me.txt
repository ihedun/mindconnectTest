I have been working in "True-ag" for 2 years and 9 months.
Ive worked with various frameworks and tools.
I've developed sites from scratch and also dealt with support sites.
Basically, my task was to develop corporate websites and online stores.
I have been faced with tasks on sites that were written without using any frameworks.
I also improved the translation system that we used for online stores.
I've developed a module for constructor and custom forms for web pages.
I've developed templates for online store sites and corporate sites that allow you to develop sites much faster.
I've worked with parsing third-party sites and Excel documents.
I've worked with 1С synchronization.
I've worked with different API's.
I've connected to site payment systems such as PayPal, Belgazprombank, Fondy, and LIQPAY.
I consider myself a leader in my company and team player with excellent communication skills.
Over the last year of my work,
I've had to make many decisions myself since I took the place of a senior programmer in our company after his dismissal.
I don’t have any sites on the github, but I have several public ones on the bitbucket:
